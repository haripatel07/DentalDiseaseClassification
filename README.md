# Dental Disease Classification

## Introduction
This project focuses on classifying dental diseases using deep learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model capable of distinguishing between different types of dental conditions based on image data. The dataset consists of labeled dental images, and the approach includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution and characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Organizing and augmenting images for better model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing deep learning architectures for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy and performance on test data.

The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and follows a structured pipeline for dataset handling, training, and evaluation.
This project classifies dental diseases using deep learning with **ResNet18** in PyTorch. The dataset consists of images categorized into different oral health conditions, preprocessed and trained using a CNN-based approach.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Image augmentation and transformation
- Model: **ResNet18** fine-tuned for multi-class classification
- Training: PyTorch with optimizer tuning and learning rate scheduling
- Evaluation: Accuracy, classification report, precision-recall curve
- Visualization: Confusion matrix and performance metrics

## Dataset
The dataset includes images of various dental diseases:
- **Calculus**
- **Caries**
- **Gingivitis**
- **Ulcers**
- **Tooth Discoloration**
- **Hypodontia**

## Results
- Achieved **91% test accuracy** in disease classification
- Achieved **high accuracy** in disease classification
- Precision-recall curves demonstrate model performance
- Confusion matrix visualizes correct and incorrect classifications
